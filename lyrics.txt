Big dawg, big house, big moves, ruff
Her hands tied up is the only type of cuff
I f*ck wit honestly, miss me wit apologies
You should been known that this ain’t regular
Stupid lit, posted, so I threw on Cellular
Tropical punch in my mug with the secular
If I freestyle then you better check ya temperature
Have you faint quick, swiftly I’m the predator
Apex, paychecks, direct like a messenger
Must I, say less, dicking down a fine broad
I was on a thin line, got up to a good grind
Pedal after pedal
Used to laugh at Chowder
Funny lil purple dude baking purple nurples
Now I’m in the kitchen, cooking bacon, no commercials
On Netflix, Guy Ritchie is my favorite
Add this to ya playlist
Think it’s time for greatness
So many faces
Flowers in some vases
Give it to my Ma
Take her to the movies
Icee, red blue, Kung fu, nice
If I fell back
It’s nothing
Find me in a bag
Or sumthin
She fell in my lap
I caught that
You fell off the map
You not missed
She gave me her number and that’s yo bish
She told me she ain’t been wit someone like this
Had her legs up, tied up to the sky too
Shit was so wet, told me she was shy too
But I fucken love it
If I fellback wtf that’s nothing
Catch me on the outside, riding - sliding
I love rough sex, not a hickey but bitemarks
I want a lil Scorpio, Libra, Sag
It’s jus who I’m compatible wit, humble brag
Plus a lil Aries, Cancer all day
All I give is love I can’t fuck wit the hate
Remember one time I had a shorty at CSUN
She called me up n told me how dinner and I would be fun
If I had a time machine I’d pull up on Hilter
Random thought I know but I be dishing the big paws
Big cause &amp; effect, expecting a check soon
Light the candle, lock the door, king of the bedroom
I ain’t really gotta say much - she know what it is
Real shit, real spit, hate that, then keep that
I was getting top swear to God she would eat that
Thing is, I don’t gotta plan to be famous
You faking, gotta make up risks that I’m taking
Amazing, got a couple sons in the making
Breaking, all the records off of the record
Chest hurt, when I slide it in like a dresser
Pressure, I ain’t even know was a word
Truth hurts, fellback then came back for dessert
I was looking at you n you was looking at me
And was thinkin’ whaaaooo-whoa-whoa-whoaaoaoo
You kno ima fuck around n change yo life right
Whether it’s right now, tomorrow or the day after that
Ima put in work
It’s just who I am
It ain’t you but at the same time it is you
Jus kick back let me just ..
Uh
Light brown, pretty toes what’s your background
Foreplay, upstairs by the hallway
Long day, I believe that, believeee in you
Keep going I like shorty’s slight work ethic
Meant it, you the canvas n my paint aesthetic
Flowing, already knowing they be getting jealous
But you keep it suitable I’m thinking suit and tie
Anything is doable when you be feeling fly
Pack a bag, and then come widdit ima book a flight
I’m a lover not a fighter but I fight for what I love
That’s enough, pussy niggas running in yo DMs Tough, I could tell, if I tuck it in that little box you’ll yell, You’ll scream but big dreams
Are only scary when you ain’t pursuing
I been getting in my bag but what the fuck these dummies doing letting you just pass by
Without a compliment at least
What’s ya name, where you goin, tell me all about your story
He a lame, think he boring, swear your feelings more Important so let’s go - to the beach
Where it’s warm and the storm don’t come round
(Ez voicemail)
