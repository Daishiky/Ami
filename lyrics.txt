What it do? What's really good?
They fell over where I stood
All these battles I withstood
I understood the need to prune the dead wood out to do it huge
Lose stress, win success
More woe is less distress
The more pain I feel, the less pain ima feel is what I meant
If you inspect my memoirs, all you'll see is silhouettes

I wanna hear y'all tell me: "Ay Nexy, you saying bold thangs on this track and I feel it"
Like a vacant hive, I'd believe it
And yes I scold cats on tracks as I'm chilling on the polar express
So cease to detest
School is ephemeral, class is eternal
The tension can't knock me down
I hustle hard to knock every door down
Until I reach the stage where the red curtains close
The stage where well wishes only make an appearance posthumously
They like to question my credibility when it come to hip-hop
I should highlight they flexibility the way they albums flip flop
They ask me if I got the heat, I say that's a loaded question
You ain't the realest without scars on your body, without question
Life is a fast lane, don't let nobody else steer your wheels
And strife that induced pain gone be used as fuel to rebuild
I preface this with the emphasis on placing a edifice that's stable
Till I walk upstairs with a halo
I sort assorted metaphor assortments in enormous portions for sport, you could've sworn the source is sorcerous
Case in point, with a bullet pencil I spin the block, with a ball pen I spin the globe
We shooting for the stars with a bow and arrow, ask Hawkeye and Sagittarius
We buzzing with no shortcuts taken to a haven where I was materialized and awakened
In a metropolis where sirens don't stop and death rates don't drop
As I maneuvered through the pavement, I became badder than Clemente every diem
So don't follow me like my shade at 5 pm
I get infected when 12 ask questions, I'm mute from the Simian Flu
Feuding is futile
I was down to be better, and I was down to elevate you
I was born in the north of us all, grown in the north, absorbed all codes, now I got the dot all on me like a acronym
My words is synonymous with law, so beware if you a antonym, figuratively speaking
I'm the personification of Polaris
As a star, I'm desirable, hella reliable, ain't liable to up it for your re-up fasho
I suspect that your vehicle for success is deranged, too late to change your course
Acquiring a timeless score rather than gwala galore is the way to go
Daily smiles reflect my ties to the outdoors
If you not among those then close that door

[Verse 3]Hold on, how about an analogy?
The knight save the day, but tonight he slay his prey
He a hunter from the hunger, the same hunger I was under from the plunders
So don't wonder why I lashed out at thangs that went over my vision
Though my vision for cheddar is on the highest level, provisions
Money make the world go square, and squares ain't even worth a sidenote
I said my tone clean on every joint I'm on like Ammonia mixed with Acetone
I go Rambo on tango, and that tango is bankroll
Put your money where your mouth is to keep it safe and sound yo
I'm confident that a confidante that fiend green finna change to a cannibal
Graduated from reaching out, now I'm a pro-finesser
Accolades flood in when the streak of you being weak ends
And that chapter is what promised me that I won't ever see sadder days
Cross me and I cross ya out
Bouts of distraught encounters in the household brought about sleepless nights from tear drought, which is hella ironic like clear doubt, and ignant teachings, and how the future gone pass, and how the young me was the old me
I'd be incarcerated for ensemble arson prior to trying rhyme larceny
Shouts out to my trials and tribulations, a simp's triumphs is simulations
I can't lie about who I am cuz I can't alter who I am
I'm in it for bread, not bread crumbs
I ain't the artist for a novice to audit
Blood dropping, veins throbbing, heart popping, hole hearted

[Verse 4]It's remarkable how when you die, your book closes, but your story don't end
It keep on changing like we in locker rooms, never mind the season punchline
But pore over how for every leaf that fall in the fall, somebody gone
Oh and only a uppercut will get your trap jumping, how's that for a punchline
I've had it with these 'lorem ipsum' rappers
Misguided, with no sense of direction in they atlas
I lump them in a cluster of amygdala hijack captives
With a fanbase packed with stans like Central Asia
Haters salty cuz the bars ain't basic
Willing to assassinate my character will only assassinate your capital
So when you was viewing me with contempt and looking down on me vexed, I commenced moving like the MVP and rose above the rest
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
But at all times, what ensues is what you choose
And one time for ma dukes, she almost passed when I was due
And for that, I can't alter who I am cuz I'm content with who I am
Can't pick one over the other like fractions, that's improper
I honed my own alone at home and wrote the ode I owed y'all before my departure:
"Dear world
Consider this artist a virtuoso
And consider this artwork a pro bono
The voyage's envoi"
[Hook]
